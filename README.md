This is a final studies project.

This project is based on the scientific paper "Data enriched linear regression" published by A.Chen, Art B. Owen and M.Shi.

It present a linear regression method for predictions on a small data set making use of a second biased data set that may be much larger. It applies penalized linear regression on L2 and L1. It also implements signatures on stochastic processes. 
The model uses plug-in and AICc-based method to tune the penalty parameter. 

The goal is to predict Apple's stock price based on NASDAQ's companies stocks.
